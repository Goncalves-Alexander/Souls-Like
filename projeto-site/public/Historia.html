                    <span>The world was once victim to a previous scourge of Demons in an ancient past before King
                        Allant
                        came to the throne. The Old One, an entity of unfathomable power, had awakened the bane of
                        existence
                        into the world, unleashing terrible Demons that ripped the land asunder, consequently
                        exterminating
                        half of humankind. Those that would become the Monumentals sought to spare the land from further
                        harm, and combined with their knowledge of Soul Arts, returned the Old One back to its slumber.
                        To
                        divide the lands amidst different regions and to return life to where there was none, they
                        ordered
                        Archstones be constructed and placed throughout the world, all of which were connected to a
                        central
                        Archstone used for inter-regional travel.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Amidst the realm of reality and death exists a place known as the Nexus, a hub for the souls who
                        traverse the ethereal worlds hoping to reclaim their bodies. Below the Nexus sleeps the Old One,
                        offering the promise of limitless prosperity to any that gives him or herself up to it. King
                        Allant
                        the XII of Boletaria dreamed of bringing eternal wealth to his mighty kingdom, and thus gave
                        himself
                        wholly to the Old One's will, awakening it from its long slumber. Prosperity did not befall
                        Boletaria, but instead the colorless fog of chaos and calamity blanketed the lands, and those
                        still
                        living were soon no longer among the sane.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The many former-citizens of Boletaria once prayed to God to grant them divinity in life. Among
                        the
                        most notable figureheads of the Kingdom's parish were Saint Urbain, a highly respected man of
                        great
                        spiritual knowledge and an abundance of faith, and the Sixth Saint Astraea, a divine Maiden
                        worshipped for her purity. Urbain's followers revered him as being in direct communion with God,
                        and
                        through him they believed His message was delivered. It is Urbain's belief that the Demons were
                        placed into Boletaria, and the fog consumed the Kingdom, as a test from God, and that all must
                        use
                        His miracles to banish the soul-thirsty horde.</span>

                        <span>
                            The world of Dark Souls is a world of cycles. Kingdoms rise and fall, ages come and go, and
                            even
                            time can end and restart as the flame fades and is renewed. These cycles are linked to the
                            First
                            Flame, a mysterious manifestation of life that divides and defines separate states such as
                            heat
                            and
                            cold, or life and death. As the First Flame fades, these differences also begin to fade,
                            such as
                            life and death having little distinction, and humans becoming Undead. The onset of an Age of
                            Dark,
                            the time when the First Flame has fully died, is marked by endless nights, rampant undeath,
                            time,
                            space, and reality breaking down, lands collapsing and converging on one another, people
                            mutating
                            into monsters, darkness covering the world, and the Gods losing their power. To avoid this
                            and
                            prolong the Age of Fire, the bearer of a powerful soul must "link" themselves to the First
                            Flame,
                            becoming the fuel for another age. If this is not done, the First Flame will eventually die,
                            and
                            an
                            Age of Dark will begin.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The powerful Lord Souls were taken from the First Flame, used to defeat the dragons, and
                            then to
                            establish kingdoms. Souls are inextricably (and inexplicably) linked to fire. Souls are
                            life,
                            and
                            life is fire; it stands to reason that souls are fire, as well. Without the First Flame and
                            without
                            souls, there is no life. The bearer of a strong soul, called a Lord, who links themselves to
                            the
                            First Flame, is thus rekindling the flames with their own soul, returning life to it. In the
                            end,
                            one could expect that all souls will have been returned to the First Flame, and the Age of
                            Fire
                            will
                            have effectively ended anyways.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is inevitable that people try to find a way around this, another way to continue the Age
                            of
                            Fire
                            without making sacrifices, but in every case they fail. In the first Age of Fire, the Witch
                            of
                            Izalith attempted to create a duplicate of the First Flame using her witchcraft and a
                            special
                            soul,
                            but failed catastrophically. Instead of making another First Flame, she had created a
                            twisted
                            Flame
                            of Chaos that produced distortions of life, turning herself and all her daughters into
                            demons.
                            These
                            demons were malevolent, and wandered the land. Gwyn gathered up his armies and fought the
                            demons
                            of
                            Chaos, eventually driving them back and shackling the Bed of Chaos to bind them. Knowing
                            that
                            the
                            Age of Fire was nearing its end, under the guidance of the primordial serpent Kingseeker
                            Frampt,
                            Gwyn offered himself to the First Flame to stave off the Dark. As the flames surged with new
                            life,
                            the knights who followed him in were burnt by the flames and now wander the world as the
                            Black
                            Knights, hollow shells of armor who attack indiscriminately.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Before he left to link the First Flame, Gwyn gave fragments of his soul to his followers and
                            allies.
                            Ornstein, Gough, Ciaran, and Artorias, his four strongest knights who fought against the
                            dragons,
                            Seath the Paledrake, who betrayed the dragons and played a crucial role in the war, and was
                            also
                            granted the title of Duke and permission to build a grand archive to conduct his research,
                            and
                            the
                            Four Kings of New Londo, who ruled a city of Undead. In time, another primordial serpent
                            convinced
                            the people of the human kingdom of Oolacile to delve into the darkness of the Abyss to
                            unearth
                            the
                            grave of an ancient human. Whether through their actions or some other means, the primordial
                            human -
                            Manus - was resurrected and driven to madness, and his wild Humanity caused the people of
                            Oolacile
                            to mutate into abominations. Manus, Father of the Abyss, began to rapidly spread Dark and
                            accelerate
                            the growth of the Abyss, and would've started an early Age of Dark had he not been defeated.
                            Even
                            so, the kingdom of Oolacile was lost to the Abyss, and eventually forgotten in the modern
                            day.
                            Nothing remains in the present day to mark the passing of this land save for Dusk, the
                            princess
                            of
                            Oolacile.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Gwyn's youngest son Gwyndolin, together with Kingseeker Frampt, sheperds the humans by
                            Gwyn's
                            command. Together they built giant asylums to house the countless undead, hoping against
                            hope
                            that
                            one of them would be chosen to defeat the Asylum demon, and fulfill their destiny. The
                            Undead
                            are
                            sent on a quest to ring the Bells of Awakening, collect the Lordvessel, slay the bearers of
                            Gwynn's
                            soul, then offer those souls to the Lordvessel to open the path to the Kiln of the First
                            Flame.
                            In
                            doing so, the unnatural Undead are given true death and the living can enjoy another age of
                            fire
                            for
                            a thousand years, while the Undead linked to the First Flame will continue to burn, alive
                            and
                            aware,
                            until someone else comes to take their place. And thus, the cycle continues.

                                <span>And yet, your journey is far from over.</span>
                                <span>Half-grown Hollow, have you what it takes, truly?</span>
                            </p>


                            Young Hollow, seek after Vendrick. <br>
                            He who almost became a true monarch. <br>
                            Vendrick is certain to guide your way. <br>
                            Fledgeling Hollow, may we meet again." <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Once you have gathered these four Great Souls a new path is opened to find the King. On your
                            path to the castle you meet the Emerald Herald once again.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            "You have acquired the soul of an Old One. <br>
                            That is more than most Undead can say.
                            <br>
                            The soul and the curse are one and the same. <br>
                            Your soul has grown stronger still. <br>
                            I only hope it brings you what you wish. <br>
                            <br>
                            Proceed, bearer of the curse. <br>
                            It is the only choice left to you. <br>
                            <br>
                            You are blessed with a myriad of souls. <br>
                            Bearer of the curse, make your way to the castle. <br>
                            <br>
                            This castle is isolated. <br>
                            But nonetheless, you must forge on. <br>
                            To bring an end to your journey‚Ä¶and mine. End your journey‚Ä¶and mine." <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Upon entering the castle you are greeted by a confused shade. <br>

                            "Who are you‚Ä¶ <br>
                            And by whose permission do you stand before me? <br>
                            This castle is the domain of King Vendrick. Is your trespass intentional? <br>
                            ‚Ä¶ <br>
                            His Highness‚Ä¶Where has he gone? <br>
                            <br>
                            You are a guest of our castle. I am the Chancellor, Wellager. <br>
                            Do you seek an audience with my Lord, King Vendrick? <br>
                            Unfortunately, His Highness is absent. <br>
                            My Lord‚Ä¶The King has‚Ä¶ <br>
                            The Queen‚Ä¶Has taken him‚Ä¶ <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My Lord made magnificent findings on souls‚Ä¶ An accomplishment for the ages‚Ä¶ <br>
                            He vanquished the Four Great Ones‚Ä¶ And built this kingdom upon their souls. <br>
                            Our King has watched over this land‚Ä¶ Since ages long, long ago‚Ä¶ <br>
                            King Vendrick‚Ä¶We must fight back‚Ä¶ Or the Giants will take Drangleic‚Ä¶<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The King had a dear Queen, a woman of unparalleled beauty.<br>
                            Long ago, the Queen came to us, alone, from a faraway land.<br>
                            She warned our Lord of the looming threat across the seas‚Ä¶of the Giants.<br>
                            The King crossed the ocean‚Ä¶ And defeated the Giants, with the Queen at his side.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The King commandeered their power‚Ä¶ And created the Golems. <br>
                            With the Golems, the king created this castle. <br>
                            To celebrate victory‚Ä¶ And to show his love, his gratitude to his Queen‚Ä¶<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Queen‚Ä¶Brought peace‚Ä¶ to this land, and to her King.<br>
                            A peace so deep‚Ä¶it was like‚Ä¶<br>
                            The Dark‚Ä¶<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Is this‚Ä¶some sort of a dream? <br>
                            ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶<br>
                            Where am I? What has happened to our castle‚Ä¶<br>
                            Who are you‚Ä¶<br>
                            And by whose permission do you stand before me?"<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>



                            As you venture further in the Castle you encounter the Queen of Drangleic, Nashandra.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            "You have fought admirably on your journey, cursed Undead.<br>
                            I am Nashandra, Queen of Drangleic.<br>
                            A true monarch carries the weight of their souls.<br>
                            The last king of this land, King Vendrick, as he was called‚Ä¶<br>
                            He was less of a king than you might imagine.<br>
                            He found the strength to rule his people, and when the Undead were born, cursed‚Ä¶<br>
                            He found more strength, to face them.<br>
                            But in the end, he never took the true throne.<br>
                            <br>
                            Visit Vendrick.<br>
                            We have no need for two rulers‚Ä¶"<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>


                            Once again you meet A Stranger who has a monstrous appearance.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            "Heheh, I believe we've been acquainted.<br>
                            Young Hollow, conqueror of fear.<br>
                            What drives you so, to overcome this supposed curse?<br>
                            <br>
                            Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.<br>
                            Some are true to their purpose, though they are but shells, flesh and mind.<br>
                            One man lost his own body, but lingered on, as a head.<br>
                            Others chase the charms of love, however elusive.<br>
                            What is it that drives you?<br>
                            <br>
                            Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity.<br>
                            And men assumed a fleeting form.<br>
                            These are the roots of our world.<br>
                            Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite...<br>
                            A lie will remain a lie.<br>
                            Young Hollow, knowing this, do you still desire peace?"<br>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            He sumuarizes many of the NPCs storylines and even hints at how the Chosen Undead was Lied
                            to.<br>
                            Then he proceeds to question your task, before leaving.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            " Vendrick, the near-true monarch, is here, and not far off.<br>
                            But what is a king?<br>
                            You, neither born with greatness, nor granted it by the fates.<br>
                            What is it that you seek?<br>
                            You cannot even say yourself.<br>
                            We shall meet again, young Hollow."<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Upon Entering the Undead Crypt you are beseached by a Grave Warden.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            " Halt.<br>
                            Human. Do not produce light.<br>
                            Light, and all those who bear it, are unwelcome in this place.<br>
                            <br>
                            I am Agdayne. Guardian of the crypt.<br>
                            Countless dead rest here in peace. Cradled by the comfort of dark.<br>
                            Light only agitates. We have no need for it here.<br>
                            <br>
                            I am a Fenito. We weave death, and watch over the dead.<br>
                            This task was granted to me by the one who gave us the first death.<br>
                            Countless souls rest here. Some of them from ages long ago.<br>
                            Some were rich, others poor. Some wise, some dull, but now, they are all just dead.<br>
                            <br>
                            This place is welcome to all, provided due reverence is shown.<br>
                            Death is equitable, accepting. We will all, one day, be welcomed by her embrace.<br>
                            Tell me what you desire. Show me reverence, and I will lend you my hand.<br>
                            <br>
                            In the past, humans were one with the dark.<br>
                            The former King of Light‚Ä¶He feared humans. Feared that they would usher in an age of
                            dark.<br>
                            How queer, you humans. How you go on, never separating truth from fiction.<br>
                            <br>
                            Did you come for him? The one called Vendrick.<br>
                            You will find him deeper inside.<br>
                            Many castle servants and the like have come to fetch their lord.<br>
                            But they rest here now, put to death by the King's own guards.<br>
                            Perhaps he's not in the mood for company."<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Further in you finally meet Vendrick who has hollowed. It us up to you to either Slay him
                            and
                            or<br>
                            take his ring. Upon Leaving the Grave Warden mentions.<br>

                            Life is never easy, never fair. Even more so, on this path you've chosen.<br>
                            May you find your peace one day"<br>

                            As you retrace your footsteps, you find yourself once again in Queen Nashandra's
                            Presence.<br>
                            "Brave Undead, seek the throne.<br>

                            With a new quest in hand you seek out the symbols of the king. You find yourself in front of

                            and cross a rope bridge. At the Bonfire in what is called the Dragon Shrine you encounter

                            back to the origins of the unkindled.
                            <br>
                            There are some speculations about what it means to be Unkindled. First of all, upon killing
                            certain unkindled NPCs they drop ashes, meaning they were burned at some point before
                            reviving.
                            Thus Unkindled are perhaps either related to the bornfire creation process, or they are
                            nameless
                            Accursed undead who linked the First Flame but died in the process. The Lords of Cinder, on
                            the
                            other hand, were beings so powerful they did survive the linking and turned into Cinder
                            instead
                            of mere Ash.
                            <br>
                            The first hint supporting this theory is a play between the words Cinder and Ash. The latter
                            refers to what remains after a material has been burnt completely while Cinder means that it
                            has
                            not been consumed completely. The Undead throw themselves in the bonfire and fuel the Flame
                            but
                            they are entirely consumed in the process, leaving only ashes that need embers to ignite.
                            These
                            ashes are found numerous times throughout the journey of the game, implying the cyclical
                            nature
                            of Dark and Flame. The intro sentence "Ash seeketh embers" takes shape now. Embers in the
                            game
                            are defined as:
                            <br>
                            "No Unkindled can ever truly claim the embers that burn within a champion‚Äôs bosom, which is
                            precisely what makes their yearning for warmth so keen. Gain the strength of flame and
                            increase
                            max HP until death. With the strength of fire, the summoning signs of Unkindled become
                            visible,
                            and seekers of embers can be summoned to join in co-operation. But beware the embers may
                            also
                            attract invaders."
                            <br>
                            From DSII we know that many generations passed and many indivuals sacrified themselves to
                            link
                            the Flame and rekindle the fire. Lords of Cinder, came many generations after, and it is
                            rare
                            for someone to survive the fire. It seems one must be powerful in a unique way to survive
                            and
                            even then their form changes. Gwyn was a Lord of Cinder, but it is clear that his form was
                            changed by the linking and it was a great sacrifice even for one as great as him. A vast
                            amount
                            of generations passed, we would obviously have many of unkindled and, of course, many amount
                            of
                            tombs in the Cemetery of Ash. We also fight against a manifestation of all Undead who linked
                            the
                            fire, that is, the Soul of Cinder, who seems to be good at all fighting styles.
                            <br>
                            Another hint supporting that Lords of Cinder did not burn completely and stayed alive after
                            linking the fire is the fact that all unkindled resurrect with their human forms. All Lords
                            of
                            Cinder wake up with their charred corpses, like Ludleth, and they all seem to have gained
                            certain amount of fire power, juding by their boss fights. Aldrich did not die either, he
                            had a
                            vision of an upcoming Age of the Deep Sea, so he started devouring Gods.
                            <br>
                            The last detail relating the Unkindled to all of the previous Undead who sacrified
                            themselves
                            for the Flame is found in a song. The name of this song is mentioned in the intro of DSIII.
                            when
                            you beat DSI you see your character burning in the kiln and then The Nameless Song starts to
                            play. This sad tone is played at the end of your quest and it is what defines your
                            character.
                            Our characters did everything and died a thousand of times just to be a sacrifice to extend
                            the
                            age of the gods. It happened many times, and they are nameless, no one is going to remember
                            their names or write poems about them.
                            <br>
                            Whatever unkindled are, their task is clear. They have to seek out the Lords Of Cinder in
                            order
                            to reenact relinking the First Flame and preserve the age of fire. They are also undead who
                            are
                            not fully bound by the hollowing process we saw in past games, needing to acquire Dark
                            Sigils in
                            order to go Hollow.
                            <br>
                            The Lords of Cinder
                            "If the lords will not return to their thrones themselves, let them return as cinders."
                            <br>
                            One becomes a Lord of Cinder by relinking the First Flame in the Kiln and Surviving. There
                            are
                            currently 5 Lords of Cinder, all 5 of their ashes are needed to reenact the Linking of the
                            First
                            Flame. The 5 Lords are Aldrich Saint of the Deep, Ludleth the Exiled, Yhorm the Giant,
                            Farron's
                            Undead Legion, and Lothric, the last hope of his line.
                            <br>
                            Ludleth the Exiled linked the First Flame long ago by willing himself to. Aldrich was once a
                            cleric that devoured men. He became so powerful that he was used to relink the Flame. Upon
                            ascension to a Lord of Cinder, Aldrich sought to devour gods and even gained a cult around
                            him
                            that formed the Sable Church of the Deep.
                            <br>
                            Farron's Undead Legion of Abyss Watchers partook of the blood of an ancient wolf, the Wolf's
                            blood linked the Abyss watchers to their master, the legendary Artorias of the Abyss.
                            Emulating
                            Artorias, the Abyss Wachers guard against creatures from the Abyss. The Abyss Watchers swore
                            on
                            their share Wolf's Blood to relink the Flame.
                            <br>
                            Yhorm the Giant sought to end the Profaned flame by relinking the First Flame. Instead of
                            Eliminating the Profaned Flame, the capital burned killing all except Yhorm. Pontif Sulyvahn
                            travelled to the Profaned Capital and saw the Profaned Flame. This hints that Yhorm linked
                            the
                            Flame before Aldrich.
                            <br>
                            Lothric refused to relink the Flame, choosing instead to allow the Flame to fade as he
                            watched
                            it from a distance with his brother.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Deep
                            "The deep was originally a peaceful and sacred place, but became the final rest for many
                            abhorrent things. This tale of the Deep offers protection for those who worship amidst those
                            horrors."
                            <br>
                            "These insects which lurk in the Deep have tiny jaws lined with fangs to tear open the skin
                            and
                            burrow into the flesh in the blink of an eye, causing intense bleeding."
                            <br>
                            "Souls which swell from the deep pursue their target, drawn towards life."
                            <br>
                            "A gem of infused titanite. Found in the dregs of the Cathedral of the deep. Used in
                            infusion to
                            create deep weapons. Deep weapons inflict dark damage, but lose scaling effects. There is a
                            darkness that lies beyond human ken."
                            <br>
                            As stated in the Dark Souls summary, the Abyss was not created until the events that took
                            place
                            in Oolacile, and it was born after Manus humanity went wild due to torture. Humanity is
                            described as something warm but at the same time dangerous, so when disturbed it created the
                            Abyss. Artorias traveled here in order to stop it and it is stated, in his ring, that he
                            made a
                            pact with the creatures of the abyss not to be corrupted and killed. This part is key
                            because we
                            are told that humanity is born from the dark soul, which implies darkness. But this darkness
                            is
                            not inneherntly evil, until it got disturbed, and created the Abyss. The Abyss corrupts
                            everything and kills everyone but it seems that some creatures inhabit this peculiar place.
                            <br>
                            From the descriptions above we can see that the Deep was initially calm but it became a
                            place
                            for abhorrent creatures. There are insects in the Deep that basically kill all life. The
                            Deep is
                            Dark, but a Dark that lies beyond humanity, which is also dark. The Deep could be the Abyss.
                            When Lord Souls are disrupted you create monstruosities. The Witch of Izalith tried to
                            create a
                            First Flame with her own Lord Soul and she just created Chaos. Oolacile people disrupted a
                            fragment of the Dark Soul ( Manus) and they created the Abyss.
                            <br>
                            A last hint about the nature of the Deep is given by the Farron's Undead Legion boss soul
                            weapons, the Wolf Knight's Greatsword and the Farron Greatsword, since both swords deal a
                            bonus
                            damage against Aldrich and the Deacons of the Deep. These weapons are designed to fight
                            against
                            the abyss, and deal more damage to abyssal foes, hence Aldrich and the Deacons are related
                            to
                            the Abyss.
                            <br>
                            Aldrich, Saint of the Deep
                            Aldrich is another Lord of Cinder that neglected his duties, having his own ambitions after
                            the
                            linking of the fire. He was a cleric in the past but at some point he started eating human
                            flesh, and he sure enjoyed it, as can be seen from Aldrich Ruby or Saphire:
                            <br>
                            "Infamous for his appetite for flesh apparently had the desire to share with others his joy
                            of
                            imbibing the final shudders of life while luxuriating in his victim's screams"
                            <br>
                            He is probably the founder of the Cathedral of the Deep, where he got some followers for his
                            cult, maybe due to fear. His victims were transported from the Undead Settlement to the
                            Cathedral through the Road of Sacrifices. This is inferred from the Evangelist Set:
                            <br>
                            "These teachers, all women, came to enlighten inhabitants of the Undead Settlement and sent
                            carriers on the path of sacrifice."
                            <br>
                            It is also stated that Horace did evade being devoured alive and survived, along with other
                            children, hinted to be Anri. This hint comes mainly from the fixation of Anri to kill
                            Aldrich
                            ever since our first encounter, being even a summon. Horace Exceutioner's Armor also tells
                            us
                            something:
                            <br>
                            "Steel armor of Horace the Hushed, who took a liking to its cold, bulky insides. The
                            original
                            owner was said to be a corrupt executioner, who was killed and stripped of his armor. Horace
                            is
                            one of only two children to escape Aldrich's clutches."
                            <br>
                            At some point the flame started to fade and the Undead curse arose again, so he probably ate
                            undead humans too. What points this out is the high amount of weak undead bodies outside the
                            cathedral, bodies that Aldrich did not finish, as the grave warden set seems to suggest:
                            <br>
                            "Rotting, tattered skirt, robe, hood and wrap. Attire of grave wardens at the Cathedral of
                            the
                            Deep. Grave wardens were tasked with disposing of the ever rising corpses that plagued the
                            cathedral. Their clothes are utterly putrid, drenched in the blood and mucilage of their
                            undertaking."
                            <br>
                            We said before that Aldrich started being a cleric, but then he got corrupted. It is unknown
                            wether the corruption took place before eating so many humans but he grew (pun intended)
                            fond of
                            The Abyss. It could be that, after killing so many humans and enjoying the suffering from
                            his
                            victims while they were being eaten alive, he disrupted a significant amount of the dark
                            soul,
                            turning himself into an abyss like creature.
                            <br>
                            After some time, whoever ruled the kingdom made him link the flame, not for saint but for
                            might,
                            as Hawkwood tells us. He then had visions of the upcoming age of the Deep Sea so he started
                            devouring Gods instead. This might have two possible explanations. The age of fire means the
                            age
                            of Gods, so he would try to get rid of all the gods for one day ruling in an age of dark.
                            Second, he would need to become something more powerful to survive if The Abyss spreads.
                            Cinders
                            of a Lord and Soul of Aldrich respectively read:
                            <br>
                            " Aldrich became a lord by devouring men, but was disillusioned with his throne, and so took
                            to
                            devouring gods instead."
                            <br>
                            "When Aldrich ruminated on the fading of the fire, it inspired visions of a coming age of
                            the
                            deep sea. He knew the path would be arduous, but he had no fear. He would devour the gods
                            himself."
                            <br>
                            In any case, he devoured some Gods and linked the fire, then his body of cinder was took to
                            the
                            tomb. When he awakened he marched from the Cathedral to Anor Londo to have a gift from
                            Sulyvahn,
                            Gwyndolin. It is possible that when we fight him he is still devouring the god of the
                            darkmoon,
                            since we still see part of him. If this is right then it means that Priscilla is alive,
                            since he
                            had a dream about her while devouring Gwyndolin. Darkmoon Longbow and Lifehunt Scythe:
                            <br>
                            "Longbow of Darkmoon Gwyndolin, who was gradually devoured by Aldrich.This golden bow is
                            imbued
                            with powerful magic and is most impressive with Moonlight Arrows."
                            <br>
                            "Aldrich dreamt as he slowly devoured the God of the Darkmoon. In this dream, he perceived
                            the
                            form of a young, pale girl in hiding."
                            <br>
                            The Profaned Flame
                            Profaned Flame wielded by the Irithyllian witches. Lonely Yhorm became a Lord of Cinder to
                            put
                            the Profaned Flame to rest, knowing full well that those who spoke of him as lord were quite
                            insincere. The Profaned Capital was consumed by fire after Yhorm the Giant became a Lord of
                            Cinder. The fire, born of the sky, is said to have incinerated naught but human flesh. The
                            Profaned Flame was triggered by the curse of these women, relatives of a certain oracle, but
                            despite their culpability, they went on living, without any cares.

                            The Darksign and the Eclipse
                            The Darksign is a symbol of the undead. Those cursed with it are reborn after death and
                            eventually lose their minds and turn hollow. This is a reason why undead are driven from
                            their
                            homes as they eventually go mad. Horace is a sample of this, originally being a member of
                            the
                            Blue Sentinals covenant and stated friend of Anri, but later being found attacking anyone he
                            meets.
                            <br>
                            The eclipse appears in Lothric Castle, and several other areas, after Lothric Castle is
                            unlocked. It may be a sign called by the fading flame, and looks a bit like a Darksign.
                            *Speculation* Maybe it's calling Undead to link it and prolong its life. Maybe its
                            symbolizing
                            that the Fire is fading and the Age of Fire is ending.

                            Multiple Firelink Shrines

                            "Sword missing from the shrine bonfire. Thrust into the shrine bonfire to restore its power
                            and
                            enable travel between bonfires. This sword is only bequeathed to chosen ash, as judged by
                            the
                            Iudex, who awaits the arrival of ash as a scabbard"
                            <br>
                            When you start the game you find yourself in the Cemetery of Ash and venture to Firelink
                            Shrine.
                            In this Firelink Shrine you must insert the Coiled Sword into the bone and ash pile of the
                            bonfire to be able to use it. When you use the Firelink bonfire to warp to Lothric for the
                            first
                            time you are warped to an altar with a basin and a broken coiled sword.
                            <br>
                            Fragment of the coiled sword of a bonfire which served its purpose long ago. Returns caster
                            to
                            last bonfire used for resting, or to the bonfire in Firelink Shrine. Can be used repeatedly.
                            Bonfires are linked to one another irreversibly, retaining their affinity long after their
                            purpose is exhausted
                            <br>
                            Later on in the game you come across an area identical to Firelink called Untended Graves.
                            Here
                            you find a dark shrine with a Fragment of the Coiled Sword in it.
                            <br>
                            Towards the end of the game on your journey to the Kiln, you are warped to one more copy of
                            Firelink called the Flameless Shrine. The Flameless Shrine is in even worse condition than
                            Untended Graves and it is here you find a bonfire that warps you to the Kiln.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            THEORY 1
                            <br>
                            There are three versions of firelink shrine. The first is where we appear, good old fire
                            link,
                            its filled with friendly npcs, Andre, handmaid, firekeeper...the rest of those lovable guys.
                            Once the consumed king is defeated, we are given access to an illusory wall that leads us to
                            untended graves. Suprisingly, this area is a mimic of firelink. Except its consumed by the
                            abyss, no sky, all blackness. Is this a similar building? No its not. Messages you leave in
                            firelink will match messages found in the "dark" firelink accessed through untended graves.
                            As
                            well as items brought over by npcs, like the scrolls of Orbeck, or the pots and goods of
                            Greirat. It is the same building. But how? Speculation time!
                            <br>
                            Time travel. This may sound odd, but forces in souls game have enabled time travel, like the
                            memory areas in dark souls 2. This dark version is firelink of the present. This is also why
                            you
                            have to warp to Lothric, or time travel to Lothric by the bonfire as the actually current
                            state
                            of the bonfire is well, its dead, consumed by the abyss. Im going to speculate harder by
                            suggesting that time power is how the bonfire heals and why armor is "repaired" when you
                            rest as
                            well as enemies being resetted. It can reset certain aspects of the world. But its not
                            exactly
                            reversing everything, as certain things remain changed. This theory has holes as well,
                            activated
                            levers stay activated, and certain enemies stay killed if killed...etc.
                            <br>
                            Anyway, back on topic, still with time travel. So the dark shrine may be our shrine, but in
                            the
                            future. Ive tried skipping Orbeck and Greirat, just murdering Emma and getting there, and
                            the
                            scrolls and pots in my previous play through were not there. When I found them, the items
                            they
                            left stayed there. We even have a corpse of a fire keeper that drops the eyes of a fire
                            keeper,
                            which is hidden in an illusory wall where the nun would stay. So basically the firelink from
                            the
                            past is trying to save itself and prevent its current, dark shrine state. As to why the
                            handmaid
                            is still alive, I have no idea. Maybe she hid with an item, maybe she killed them all. Maybe
                            she
                            was spared as she is just an old lady.
                            <br>
                            Then we have the next flame. The one that takes us to the final boss. Its a ruined version
                            of
                            firelink, this one is damaged with up with many collapsed pathways. Upon exiting it we find
                            lothric and a strange dark, sort of night atmosphere. We seem to have a crazy eclipse going
                            on,
                            and it looks like part of the earth was torn off or ripped out and sent somewhere else. The
                            Lothric castle has parts of it collapsed and sloped, like some crazy earthquake or event
                            occured. This could be firelink of the future. Please note that while the dark firelink
                            shrine
                            is covered in an abyss, the rest of Lothric is fine. This is because the firelink shrine,
                            birthplace of the powerful fire, is a special ground. Its paranormal. As the fire weakens
                            and
                            dies, its surrounding area goes to hell. It is swallowed in an abyss and seems to be
                            separated
                            from the world(dark shrine). This gets worse in the future as now the firelink and its
                            surrounding area seems to be caught in a crazy cataclysm(final area). Its become some vortex
                            that sucks its surroundings to where ever it came from, though very slowly. More
                            speculation!
                            this vortex converges the surrounding lands into the source of the flame. The thing we
                            actually
                            link. Think of it like this, the fire is hurting and its trying to pull back to safety
                            because
                            of the pain. as everything converges, the source is revealed, and the champion of ash may
                            fullfill his duty, link it, prolong its life in our world of plane, and change the future,
                            extending the age of fire.

                            <br>
                            THEORY2
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            That was wild and filled with speculation, sorry bout that, here is a shorter theory!
                            Another
                            possibility, is a parallel world, an alternate universe of sorts. We know that undead keep
                            reviving. Hawkwood says it himself that they " cant die properly". But why does Hawkwood die
                            properly when we kill him? Why does killing Aldrich with Anri, have no influence on the
                            Aldrich
                            of our world. ( Killing him w Anri will not mean that the one we have to face will be dead,
                            you
                            have to kill the one in your world, regardless if you helped Anri slay him ). I think to
                            each
                            undead, the fire presents a "parallel world". Killing an npc will revive them in their
                            world,
                            but in our world, they will have lost "connection" and appear "dead". Npcs very connected to
                            our
                            world, like the firekeeper, will revive just like monsters, if killed. All the others are
                            like
                            other players, with a weaker, sort of temporary connection.
                            <br>
                            Anyway, theory two is that the first flame is fading, so fire from other "worlds" all
                            connected

                        <h3>The Hunters and The Hunt</h3>
                        <p>
                            The hunters are a group of warriors who are dedicated to keeping their regions safe by hunting down beasts - or anything other than beasts if need be - that pose a threat. Hunters are agile fighters armed with a trick weapon, a transforming melee weapon in the right hand, and a firearm in the left. They do not employ shields, but rather take advantage of their mobility in order to avoid attacks. Hunters exist throughout the world and are not exclusive to Yharnam, since a number of characters such as the protagonist and Eileen come from the outside world and are yet still recognized as hunters. However, it is believed that the Hunters started out as a branch of the Healing Church very much like The Choir. This would mean that, at least in Yharnam, Hunters were recruited by either Gehrman or the Church itself.
                        </p>
                            
                        <h3>The City of Yharnam</h3>
                        <p>
                            Yharnam is a towering, labyrinthine gothic city, home to both the Healing Church and the Blood Ministrations. As no evidence of the existence of a ruling body is provided in the game, one may presume that the Healing Church controls the city (at least indirectly). The Church focuses around healing by infusions of blood. Miraculously, blood healing can repair wounds and cure or hinder diseases. Yharnam's whole culture became focused on blood, even to the point of blood-based drinks surpassing alcoholic beverages as the most commonly consumed. Yharnam's populace is apparently viewed as insane or degenerate by the wider world, and the citizens have become extremely distrustful of non-natives as a result.

                        <h3>The Red Moon</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Red Moon is a nightmare revealed after slaying Rom, the Vacuous Spider who had placed a veil over the world to keep the secret of the true nature of the world from its residents. The servants of Amygdala become fully powered, the beasts become more ravenous, and the children of Amygdala are visible at last. In this nightmare, the world reveals the Eldritch abominations it has been truly hiding. As a result, everything gets worse, and the character sees the world as they would if they had amassed 40 insight. Unfortunately, by killing Rom, you usher in the Red Moon, which is believed by some to be the coming of Oedon. It is not clear that Oedon is the Moon Presence, but he very well could be.

                        <h3>The Umbilical Cords</h3>
                        <p>
                            While this presents a weird part of the story, it is a known fact that 75% of the game‚Äôs umbilical cords can be found on women or children. During the Red Moon, Iosefka‚Äôs dialogue suggests that she has become pregnant, and Arianna gets pregnant as well. You also find a cord from defeating Mergo‚Äôs Wet Nurse. This suggests that  Oedon impregnates women on the Red Moon. The criteria of these women who are impregnated has not been determined. It also seems to be that the Great Ones impregnate women to have surrogate children.
                        </p>
                        It is worth noting that one of the four umbilical cords is in the abandoned Workshop, very near the doll.
                        
                        <h3>The Scourge of the Beast</h3>
                        <p>
                            The most common form of the blood sickness appears to be lycanthropy: Humans slowly turning into wolves. Those in the early stages of the sickness have lengthened canine teeth and grow more hair. As they progress, their arms and legs lengthen and the spine hunches over and the face begins to elongate. Eventually, they grow fur and their body finishes the change into a Scourge Beast. Along with the physical transformation comes a mental degradation: At first the victim assumes all people they don't know are hostile and they'll attack on sight. As the alterations progress, the victim becomes more and more savage and hostile, until it can only stand to be around others exactly like it as "regular" humans appear to be beasts through their own blood-addled eyes. Sometimes individuals react strangely to the blood; some become unique beasts, and it's rumored that infected Clerics of the Healing Church become the largest of the monsters when they succumbed to the madness. (As seen in Laurence, Ludwig, the Vicar Amelia, etc.)
                            The blood sickness seems to be endemic to Yharnam, requiring periodic hunts for those very far gone. The hunters are both respected and feared: They bring down the worst of the beasts, but are at risk of contamination themselves.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Old Yharnam, Ashen Blood, and The Powder Kegs</h3>
                        <p>
                            Eventually, Old Yharnam was founded (obviously just ‚ÄúYharnam‚Äù at the time), but it was brought low by a strange (the text says ‚Äúbaffling‚Äù) illness known as Ashen Blood, which was a worse form of slow/fast poison. The antidote description cites it as being a more severe case, and in the case of Ashen Blood, the antidotes only provided temporary relief. Eventually, the disease (likely spread due to blood ministrations) took over, and those infected turned into beasts. This is why the beasts in Old Yharnam are poisonous, particularly the red-eyed werewolf near the boss, and why the Blood-Starved Beast is coated with poison. After the fall of Old Yharnam, it was closed up, and Central Yharnam was built, along with the Grand Cathedral. This is perhaps the first instance of ‚Äúhunters‚Äù as we know them now being formed.
                            The Powder Kegs were a group of hunters that tried to make explosive weapons, to varying degrees of success. A few prided creations of the Powdered Kegs are the Stake Driver, the Rifle Spear, and the Cannon. However, due to differences in designs, they were banned from the Workshop, becoming known as Workshop Heretics.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Blood Ministration and The Healing Church</h3>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps the most influential of the organizations, the Healing Church was founded in the wake of the Choir. There were three echelons to the church: black-garbed hunters, white-garbed ‚Äúdoctors,‚Äù and the Choir. Though they did not spring from Byrgenwerth directly, they were explorers who found the labyrinth in the wake of that place and discovered the same remnants of the Truth, and used the research done there already to kick off their own research. However, their form of metamorphosis began with Blood Ministrations and their research/experiments with the blood.
                            Master Laurence, the founder of the Healing Church, and one of Master Willem's apprentices believed that in order to transcend humanity they had to research blood healing using Old Blood. During the times of Byrgenwerth, Master Willem taught all of his student to blindfold themselves so that they can "look into oneself" and that they needed to "line their brain with eyes" in order to see what the Great Ones see and acquire more eldritch knowledge, also known as insight, to further evolve into greater beings. With insight, they were able to see the world for what it is, beyond human comprehension. One of the most important of Willem's teachings is the Byrgenwerth adage "Fear the Old Blood". For only Willem respects and fears the true nature of the Old Blood in the beginning.
                            According to the memory shown by the skull in the altar of the Grand Cathedral. Master Laurence strayed from Master Willem's teachings and their paths eventually diverged. Laurence chose a different path to use the Old Blood for his experiments in order to move forward, disregarding the adage "Fear the Old Blood". He then founded the Healing Church and spread the teachings of the art of Blood Ministration. Later on, as blood healing became more common among the citizens of Yharnam, some citizens began transforming into beasts. At this point, Master Laurence discovered his mistake of using Old Blood for when it is mixed with human blood, it transforms subjects into beast. This is where Yharnam's plague of beast started.
                            We can tell that Master Laurence deeply regrets his decision of using Old Blood through his notes around the Lecture Building. These notes also leave clues what one must do to transcend the hunt, which he later found out after realizing his mistakes. "Master Willem was right. Evolution without courage will be the ruin of our race". "Hunt the Great ones. Hunt the Great ones". "Three third Umbilical cords"
                            From the Caryll Rune Beast: "Beast" is one of the early Caryll Runes. as well as one of the first to be deemed forbidden. "The discovery of blood entailed the discovery of undesirable beasts".

                        <h3>The Choir, The Cosmos and Ebrietas</h3>
                        <p>
                            The leaders of the healing church, the Choir differentiate themselves from the rest of the members of the church as they received teachings directly from Ebrietas. Ebrietas, daughter of the cosmos  is a celestial being who emerged from the depth of the Old Labyrinth and acted as a source of knowledge to the healing church with seemingly no ill-will thus furthering the notion that the Great Ones are sympathetic to humans. Not only did Ebrietas grant members of the Choir profound knowledge, but she also further convinced them that they could commune with the Great Ones and learn the Eldritch Truth. They believed they could ascend to the Cosmos (or at least make contact with it), and it came in a sudden and unexpected realization that perhaps while their feet were rooted to the ground, the cosmos was not immeasurably far away, but right above their heads. Together with Ebrietas, the Choir worked tirelessly to understand the Great One‚Äôs Truth.
                        </p>
                            
                        <h3>The School of Mensis and the Mensis Ritual</h3>
                        <p>
                            Members of the School of Mensis desperately seek communion with the Great Ones, to the point of near (if not) insanity. Typically found wearing Mensis cages, a follower of the School of Mensis could be distinguished from a normal person from a mile away. But they certainly don't care about other humans' opinions as much as they do the Great Ones'.
                            Despite sharing the same goal with the Healing Church, the School of Mensis and the Healing Church do not seem to get along - this is indicated by the corpse of a Choir member locked away in the Unseen Village, which happens to be founded and controlled by the School of Mensis.
                            The founder of the School of Mensis, Micolash  seems to have telepathic powers, being able to plant nightmares and illusions into the minds of his victims. This might indicate the School of Mensis having foul intent if they succeed in communicating with the Great Ones. They may have turned the knowledge and power they obtained onto the people, which would explain the tension between them and the Healing Church.
                            The pertinent Umbilical Cord for the School of Mensis' description reads as follows after obtaining it from Murgo's Wet Nurse in the Nightmare: "Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate. This Cord granted Mensis audience with Mergo, but resulted in the stillbirth of their brains." When Micolash and his ilk used this cord to commune with The Infant Great One, they discovered that the power was too much and it killed the whole School of Mensis, locking the survivors in the Nightmare Realm that Micolash controls and driving them all insane. Whether or not this was intended by Mergo is up for debate

                        <h3>Cainhurst, The Vilebloods, and the Executioners</h3>
                        <p>
                            In Cainhurst Castle, Queen Annalise was a ruler over many nobles and dandies, the first Vileblood that partook in corrupted blood from Byrgenwerth. Having the ability to extract the essence of hunters' blood, Queen Annalise ordered her followers to hunt down hunters without scruple, and gained notoriety for her insatiable hunger for blood.
                            Annalise consumed the blood offerings brought back by her servants, and eventually became immortal due to her vile predations. A timeless society of vampire-like entities was formed in Cainhurst Castle thereafter. It was a place of refinement and sophistication, and the occasional beast that arose from the foul practice was dispatched discreetly as well as gracefully - such is the Cainhurst way. Those who served the queen did so out of loyalty, fear, and an unending desire to taste her blood, and settled with various Caryll runes that improved Visceral Attacks as a cheap substitute (as described in the rune‚Äôs texts). Queen Annalise hoped desperately one day to bear a true heir, and dubbed this the Child of Blood, which she sought to have at all costs. She sent her Vilebloods to hunt for her, and all hoped that, with enough blood dregs, she could birth a Child of Blood.
                            However, the justice-seeking knight commander known as master Logarius took these practices as an affront, and founded the Executioners: blood-thirsty zealots looking to kill Vilebloods at all costs. Eventually they stormed Cainhurst castle, eliminating everyone inside with extreme prejudice. Ironically, the executioners slew all the maids they could find, who likely had nothing to do with Annalise's malevolence, but could not harm Annalise due to her immortality. Seeing no other option, master Logarius sent his Executioners away and martyred himself in order to prevent Annalise from ever escaping. He stands guard in front of Annalise's tower forever, sealed off with the Crown of Illusion, so that none could enter again.

                        <h3>The Great Ones</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Healing Church has pursued a strange goal for a long, long time; a goal that has been hidden from all but the highest of rank among them: to summon or harness the power of the Great Ones, beings not of this world, powerful enough to be seen as gods. They were here, in the labyrinth, long ago. They appear to be much closer than you'd think at Byrgenwerth, men were sent into the labyrinth, and an academy was built to understand the strange discoveries inside, generally called the Truth. It seems the Truth is a terrible thing, slowly breaking the mind of anyone who delves too deeply. Awful things happened at Bygenwerth, and as a result, the church closed off not only the academy, but the entire forest, calling it "forbidden".
                            Whether or not the Great Ones are actually gods or just higher levels of beings is inconsequential, the question itself is entirely academic. The important thing is: They exist. They have an influence on the world. They appear to be ageless, but they can be killed. Their powers are strange things, often involving teleportation or energy or things that the human world cannot do. Even perceiving the Great Ones properly requires great amounts of Insight--something Master Willem tried to do, at his own cost. The strongest of the Great Ones appears to be the Moon Presence, the creator of the Nightmare the Hunter is trapped within. Others are Oedon, Rom, Mergo's Wet Nurse, Amygdala, the Celestial Emissary, the Brain of Mensis, and Ebrietas.
                            Oedon, one of their number, has transcended even the others, to the point that he no longer has a physical body but instead is just a voice and an influence. He is very powerful and has become sort of "timeless", thus potentially making him the most powerful, yet the most indirect, of the Great Ones. He is also the only Great One explicitly referred to as male, with all the others' genders either female or undefined (assuming the Great Ones even have humanly-definable genders)
                            Some items' descriptions tell about Great Ones living in "The Dream" and others living in "The Nightmare" (Which is the case of Amygdala whose function is still to be defined, and Mergo's Wet Nurse). Humans have been able to contact them through the use of Phantasm, little invertebrates found in the Labyrinth.
                            Interestingly, Mergo's Wet Nurse and the Moon Presence are themselves never directly identified as Great Ones. Whether this is merely an oversight or an indication that they are indeed a different class of being is unknown.

                        <h3>Pthumerian civilization</h3>
                        <p>
                            Pthumeria was an ancient civilization ruled by Queen Yharnam. It was populated by Pthumerians, an ancient race of people who truly understood the Truth of the Great Ones and gained supernatural powers as a result. Queen Yharnam was a medium for the Great Ones, as cited by an item (saying the Choir discovered a medium, though she‚Äôs the only likely candidate). Eventually the Pthumerians retreated into a deep labyrinth, with their holy chalices being the only remnants of their ancient rituals to break the seals. Some chalices (such as the ailing Loran chalice) led to other lands, and the Isz Chalice was in particular used in holy communion with the Great Ones.

                            Filled with purpose you set out into the Kingdom of Dragleic, searching for a cure of
                            the
                            curse.
                            After traversing through the remains of an Archtree, you find yourself in a decrepit
                            town
                            called

                        <span>Bearer of the curse... I will remain by your side.</span>
                        <span>Till this frail hope shatters... Take this with you. May it ease your journey.</span>
                        <span>Go on, and see the King.</span>
                        <span>He who made Drangleic what it once was; he who peered at the essence of the
                            soul.</span>

                            This question seems to parallel Frampt's search in Dark Souls 1. The Emerald Herald
                            tasks you

                        <span>For misery will lead you to greater, stronger souls.</span>
                        <span>You will never meet the King with a soul so frail and pallid.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Seek those whose names are unutterable, the four endowed with immense souls.</span>
                        <span>Their souls will serve as beacons.</span>
                        <span>Once you have found them, return here to me.</span>
                        <span>So that hope will not fade away.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span>Bearer of the curse... Seek souls. Larger, more powerful souls.</span>
                        <span>Seek the King, that is the only way.</span>
                        <span>Lest this land swallow you whole... As it has so many others."</span>
                    </p>




                    <p>
                        <span>Before you leave town, others inform you on these unutterable ones.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>"There are four beings in this land with giant souls.</span>
                        <span>And wherever you go from here, you'll sooner or later come up against them.</span>
                        <span>Each has a powerful soul, and a terrible curse…</span>
                        <span>If that frightens you, then you ought to just give up right now. Like I have. Hah hah
                            hah"</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>"Are you going to see the Old Ones?</span>
                        <span>Those four who have grown so incredibly ancient.</span>
                        <span>They must have sprouted quite a thick coat of moss by now.</span>
                        <span>For heaven's sake, no-one even knows their names anymore!</span>
                        <span>Imagine that! Hee hee hee hee!</span>
                        <span>Yes…Nothing like yourself.</span>
                        <span>For you…have a most pleasant scent, that grows nicer with each passing day.</span>
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        <span>Once, people tried to round up the Undead and hide them away from the world.</span>
                        <span>They thought that imprisoning the Undead would solve the problem.</span>
                        <span>They created a towering bastille to contain them, but in the end, it did no
                            good.</span>
                        <span>The Lost Sinner lives deep within the bastille.</span>
                        <span>The fool. Trying to light the First Flame…</span>
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        <span>Why do people try so hard to be beautiful?</span>
                        <span>We cats are born beautiful, of course. Hee hee…</span>
                        <span>The human ego…How many ugly iron castles has it erected?</span>
                        <span>And they don't even see the folly of their ways.</span>
                        <span>But that's what makes watching humankind so delightful.</span>
                        <span>It reminds me of someone who lived long ago.</span>
                        <span>A vainglorious liar who ended up hurling himself into the flames.</span>
                        <span>Now he's Ichorous Earth, if I'm not mistaken.</span>
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        <span>You've seen that gaping hole here?</span>
                        <span>Well, there's nasty little vermin down there.</span>
                        <span>Although who you seek is even further below.</span>
                        <span>And has been down there for a very, very long time.</span>
                        <span>He's plumb Rotten by now, I'm sure! Hee hee hee…</span>
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        <span>Men develop the most peculiar fascinations.</span>
                        <span>Sometimes their fascinations seem to take control.</span>
                        <span>Till there's very little man left. Hee hee hee…</span>
                        <span>Oh, it's like that awful traitor long ago.</span>
                        <span>He coveted what he did not have, and it drove him mad.</span>
                        <span>What a curious conundrum. Hee hee hee…</span>
                        <span>The Writhing Ruin keeps searching as we speak.</span>
                        <span>Searching for its heart's desire."</span>

                            With rumors in hand and a direction to go you, seek out these four Great Souls. A mass
                            of bodies
                            in a poisoned gulch, an experimental spider in a bright cove, a forgotten prisoner in an
                            abandoned prison, and a fallen king in a sinking lava filled castle. Upon Gathering the
                            Final
                            Soul You encounter a stranger. He implores you to continue your quest.
                        </span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>"No one has come this far, not for a very long while.</span>
                        <span>Young Hollow do you wish to shed this curse?</span>
                        <span>Then accept the fate of your ilk, and face the trials that await you.</span>
                        <span>Unless, you have already joined the crestfallen.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>Young Hollow, there are but two paths. Inherit the order of this world, or destroy
                            it.</span>
                        <span>But only a true monarch can make such a choice.</span>
                        <span>Very few, indeed, have come even this far.</span>
                        <span>And yet, your journey is far from over.</span>
                        <span>Half-grown Hollow, have you what it takes, truly?</span>
                    </p>


                    Young Hollow, seek after Vendrick. <br>
                    He who almost became a true monarch. <br>
                    Vendrick is certain to guide your way. <br>
                    Fledgeling Hollow, may we meet again." <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you have gathered these four Great Souls a new path is opened to find the King. On your
                    path to the castle you meet the Emerald Herald once again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "You have acquired the soul of an Old One. <br>
                    That is more than most Undead can say.
                    <br>
                    The soul and the curse are one and the same. <br>
                    Your soul has grown stronger still. <br>
                    I only hope it brings you what you wish. <br>
                    <br>
                    Proceed, bearer of the curse. <br>
                    It is the only choice left to you. <br>
                    <br>
                    You are blessed with a myriad of souls. <br>
                    Bearer of the curse, make your way to the castle. <br>
                    <br>
                    This castle is isolated. <br>
                    But nonetheless, you must forge on. <br>
                    To bring an end to your journey…and mine. End your journey…and mine." <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Upon entering the castle you are greeted by a confused shade. <br>

                    "Who are you… <br>
                    And by whose permission do you stand before me? <br>
                    This castle is the domain of King Vendrick. Is your trespass intentional? <br>
                    … <br>
                    His Highness…Where has he gone? <br>
                    <br>
                    You are a guest of our castle. I am the Chancellor, Wellager. <br>
                    Do you seek an audience with my Lord, King Vendrick? <br>
                    Unfortunately, His Highness is absent. <br>
                    My Lord…The King has… <br>
                    The Queen…Has taken him… <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My Lord made magnificent findings on souls… An accomplishment for the ages… <br>
                    He vanquished the Four Great Ones… And built this kingdom upon their souls. <br>
                    Our King has watched over this land… Since ages long, long ago… <br>
                    King Vendrick…We must fight back… Or the Giants will take Drangleic…<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The King had a dear Queen, a woman of unparalleled beauty.<br>
                    Long ago, the Queen came to us, alone, from a faraway land.<br>
                    She warned our Lord of the looming threat across the seas…of the Giants.<br>
                    The King crossed the ocean… And defeated the Giants, with the Queen at his side.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The King commandeered their power… And created the Golems. <br>
                    With the Golems, the king created this castle. <br>
                    To celebrate victory… And to show his love, his gratitude to his Queen…<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Queen…Brought peace… to this land, and to her King.<br>
                    A peace so deep…it was like…<br>
                    The Dark…<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Is this…some sort of a dream? <br>
                    ……<br>
                    Where am I? What has happened to our castle…<br>
                    Who are you…<br>
                    And by whose permission do you stand before me?"<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>



                    As you venture further in the Castle you encounter the Queen of Drangleic, Nashandra.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    "You have fought admirably on your journey, cursed Undead.<br>
                    I am Nashandra, Queen of Drangleic.<br>
                    A true monarch carries the weight of their souls.<br>
                    The last king of this land, King Vendrick, as he was called…<br>
                    He was less of a king than you might imagine.<br>
                    He found the strength to rule his people, and when the Undead were born, cursed…<br>
                    He found more strength, to face them.<br>
                    But in the end, he never took the true throne.<br>
                    <br>
                    Visit Vendrick.<br>
                    We have no need for two rulers…"<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>


                    Once again you meet A Stranger who has a monstrous appearance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Heheh, I believe we've been acquainted.<br>
                    Young Hollow, conqueror of fear.<br>
                    What drives you so, to overcome this supposed curse?<br>
                    <br>
                    Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.<br>
                    Some are true to their purpose, though they are but shells, flesh and mind.<br>
                    One man lost his own body, but lingered on, as a head.<br>
                    Others chase the charms of love, however elusive.<br>
                    What is it that drives you?<br>
                    <br>
                    Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity.<br>
                    And men assumed a fleeting form.<br>
                    These are the roots of our world.<br>
                    Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite...<br>
                    A lie will remain a lie.<br>
                    Young Hollow, knowing this, do you still desire peace?"<br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    He sumuarizes many of the NPCs storylines and even hints at how the Chosen Undead was Lied
                    to.<br>
                    Then he proceeds to question your task, before leaving.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    " Vendrick, the near-true monarch, is here, and not far off.<br>
                    But what is a king?<br>
                    You, neither born with greatness, nor granted it by the fates.<br>
                    What is it that you seek?<br>
                    You cannot even say yourself.<br>
                    We shall meet again, young Hollow."<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Upon Entering the Undead Crypt you are beseached by a Grave Warden.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    " Halt.<br>
                    Human. Do not produce light.<br>
                    Light, and all those who bear it, are unwelcome in this place.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am Agdayne. Guardian of the crypt.<br>
                    Countless dead rest here in peace. Cradled by the comfort of dark.<br>
                    Light only agitates. We have no need for it here.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am a Fenito. We weave death, and watch over the dead.<br>
                    This task was granted to me by the one who gave us the first death.<br>
                    Countless souls rest here. Some of them from ages long ago.<br>
                    Some were rich, others poor. Some wise, some dull, but now, they are all just dead.<br>
                    <br>
                    This place is welcome to all, provided due reverence is shown.<br>
                    Death is equitable, accepting. We will all, one day, be welcomed by her embrace.<br>
                    Tell me what you desire. Show me reverence, and I will lend you my hand.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the past, humans were one with the dark.<br>
                    The former King of Light…He feared humans. Feared that they would usher in an age of dark.<br>
                    How queer, you humans. How you go on, never separating truth from fiction.<br>
                    <br>
                    Did you come for him? The one called Vendrick.<br>
                    You will find him deeper inside.<br>
                    Many castle servants and the like have come to fetch their lord.<br>
                    But they rest here now, put to death by the King's own guards.<br>
                    Perhaps he's not in the mood for company."<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Further in you finally meet Vendrick who has hollowed. It us up to you to either Slay him and
                    or<br>
                    take his ring. Upon Leaving the Grave Warden mentions.<br>

                    "You've met the King, have you?<br>
                    Life is never easy, never fair. Even more so, on this path you've chosen.<br>
                    May you find your peace one day"<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As you retrace your footsteps, you find yourself once again in Queen Nashandra's Presence.<br>
                    "Brave Undead, seek the throne.<br>
                    Follow the symbol of the monarch, and do what must be done."<br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    If you stop and speak to the Emerald Herald She tells you.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "This ring is the symbol of the King.<br>
                    Use it to gain passage, through the King's Gate… …and venture to the far east…<br>
                    Bearer of the curse, if you are to be the next monarch.<br>
                    Then, one day, you will walk those grounds… …without really knowing why."<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With a new quest in hand you seek out the symbols of the king. You find yourself in front of
                    a<br>
                    Large Keep. In this Keep You see that many experiments have taken place here and even
                    encounter<br>
                    a caged Dragon. You find yourself heading up an elevator into a a place filled with flying
                    Dragons. There you encounter the Emerald Herald.<br>
                    "Bearer of the curse.<br>
                    Long have I awaited one such as you, one who might shatter the shackles of fate.<br>
                    One who can set me free.<br>
                    Bearer of the curse, it was my own manifestation that led you here.<br>
                    The ancient dragon has watched over the world for aeons past.<br>
                    Take this. Do not resist. The dragon welcomes you."<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Emerald Herald Gives you an Aged Feather as a Gift. You tread further into this Dragon
                    Aerie<br>
                    and cross a rope bridge. At the Bonfire in what is called the Dragon Shrine you encounter

                    Shackled by falsehoods, they yearn for love, unaware of its grand illusion.<br>
                    Until, the curse touches their flesh.<br>
                    We are bound by this yoke.<br>

                    But is this so wrong?<br>
                    A construction, a facade, and yet...<br>
                    A world full of warmth and resplendence.<br>
                    Young Hollow, are you intent on shattering the yoke, spoiling this wonderful falsehood?<br>

                    Further on in the Shrine you encounter the Ancient Dragon. Who gifts you with the Ashen Mist

                    "Brave Undead, what did that dragon tell you?<br>
                    That thing is a prop, a false deity. Don't be fooled, my Undead.<br>

                    I fail to see your design, young moth.<br>
                    But I see very little, these days…"<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With a new task in hand it is time to seek out the other fallen kings and their crowns. Once
                    you<br>
                    have Acquired the Crown's from the fallen Monarch's Vendrick will Give you his Blessing after
                    he<br>
                    gives you his insight.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Seeker of fire, conqueror of Dark.<br>
                    I, too, sought fire, once.<br>
                    With fire, they say, a true king can harness the curse.<br>
                    A lie. But I knew no better…<br>
                    Seeker of fire, you know not the depths of Dark within you.<br>
                    It grows deeper still, the more flame you covet.<br>
                    Flame, oh, flame…<br>
                    <br>
                    I am king of this wretched, unravelled kingdom.<br>
                    I subdued the Giants, and claimed their strength.<br>
                    So that I might step closer to fire…<br>
                    Drangleic will fall, the fire will fade, and the souls of old will reemerge.<br>
                    With Dark unshackled, a curse will be upon us…<br>
                    And men will take their true shape…<br>
                    <br>
                    Seeker of fire, I see you've subdued another foul creature.<br>
                    One of the Father of the Abyss' spawn, that confounded quintessence of humanity.<br>
                    The Abyss once had form, but then dissipated.<br>
                    And yet, traces of its existence endured.<br>
                    Each fragment, thirsting for power, spread Dark, with no relent.<br>
                    My dear Shandra… was one such fragment…<br>
                    A feeble, tiny thing that thirsted for power more than any other…<br>
                    Driven by insatiable lust for a worthy vessel.<br>
                    <br>
                    Fire came to be, and with it, Disparity.<br>
                    Heat and cold, life and death, Light and Dark.<br>
                    Dark was seen as a curse.<br>
                    Shadow is not cast, but born of fire.<br>
                    And, the brighter the flame, the deeper the shadow.<br>
                    Inherit fire, and harness the Dark.<br>
                    Such is the calling of a true leader…<br>
                    <br>
                    One day, fire will fade, and Dark will become a curse.<br>
                    Men will be free from death, left to wander eternally.<br>
                    Dark will again be ours, and in our true shape…<br>
                    We can bury the false legends of yore… Only…<br>
                    Is this our only choice?<br>
                    Seeker of fire, coveter of the throne.<br>
                    Seek strength.<br>
                    The rest will follow… "<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With Vendrick's Blessing in hand it is time to Seek out the Throne. On the Path to the
                    throne<br>
                    you find the Emerald Herald once more, where she warns you of Nashandra.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "My journey is already complete.<br>
                    My name is Shanalotte.<br>
                    The dragon gave me this name, for I was born with none.<br>
                    I was born of dragons, contrived by men.<br>
                    By ones who would cozen fate herself… They are the ones who created me.<br>
                    But they failed. I did not come out as intended.<br>
                    Fate would not be bested, and men were cursed once again.<br>
                    If you proceed, Nashandra will come after you.<br>
                    Knowing that you will take the throne, and link the fire.<br>
                    She covets the First Flame, and the Great Soul.<br>
                    Put Nashandra to rest."<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As you Venture forth and defeat the Throne Watcher and Defender, You are confronted by
                    Nashandra.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Brave Undead,<br>
                    you have proven yourself to me.<br>
                    Now, be one, with the Dark…"<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you defeat Nashandra you encounter Aldia. (Note if you do not have Scholar of the First
                    Sin<br>
                    or have received Vendrick's Blessing the game defaults to ending 1.) Aldia wishes to test
                    your<br>
                    resolve.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Many monarchs have come and gone.<br>
                    One drowned in poison, another succumbed to flame.<br>
                    Still another slumbers in a realm of ice.<br>
                    Not one of them stood here, as you do now.<br>
                    You, conqueror of adversities.<br>
                    Give us your answer."<br>
                    <br>
                    Once you defeat Aldia you are left with a Choice, accept the world how it is or find a new
                    path.<br>

                    <br>
                    "I lost everything, but remained here, patiently.<br>
                    The throne will certainly receive you.<br>
                    But the question remains...<br>
                    What do you want, truly?<br>
                    Light? Dark? Or something else entirely...''<br>

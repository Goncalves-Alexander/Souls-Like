                    "Only in truth the lords will abandon their thrones and the unkindled will rise. Nameless
                    accursed undead, unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers."
                    <br>
                    "They say these are the remains of a saint who cast himself into the bonfire. But we will never
                    know for sure, for soot and ashes tell no story."
                    <br>
                    As the intro says, the Unkindled are beings of ash, unworthy to ascend to become Lords of
                    Cinder. They are awakened by the tolling of a bell that rings when the First Flame is in danger
                    of fading. They awaken in the Cemetery of Ash and seek the embers of the First Flame. During the
                    whole game the protagonist is called Unkindled, Champion of Ash or Ashen One all of which harken
                    back to the origins of the unkindled.
                    <br>
                    There are some speculations about what it means to be Unkindled. First of all, upon killing
                    certain unkindled NPCs they drop ashes, meaning they were burned at some point before reviving.
                    Thus Unkindled are perhaps either related to the bornfire creation process, or they are nameless
                    Accursed undead who linked the First Flame but died in the process. The Lords of Cinder, on the
                    other hand, were beings so powerful they did survive the linking and turned into Cinder instead
                    of mere Ash.
                    <br>
                    The first hint supporting this theory is a play between the words Cinder and Ash. The latter
                    refers to what remains after a material has been burnt completely while Cinder means that it has
                    not been consumed completely. The Undead throw themselves in the bonfire and fuel the Flame but
                    they are entirely consumed in the process, leaving only ashes that need embers to ignite. These
                    ashes are found numerous times throughout the journey of the game, implying the cyclical nature
                    of Dark and Flame. The intro sentence "Ash seeketh embers" takes shape now. Embers in the game
                    are defined as:
                    <br>
                    "No Unkindled can ever truly claim the embers that burn within a champion’s bosom, which is
                    precisely what makes their yearning for warmth so keen. Gain the strength of flame and increase
                    max HP until death. With the strength of fire, the summoning signs of Unkindled become visible,
                    and seekers of embers can be summoned to join in co-operation. But beware the embers may also
                    attract invaders."
                    <br>
                    From DSII we know that many generations passed and many indivuals sacrified themselves to link
                    the Flame and rekindle the fire. Lords of Cinder, came many generations after, and it is rare
                    for someone to survive the fire. It seems one must be powerful in a unique way to survive and
                    even then their form changes. Gwyn was a Lord of Cinder, but it is clear that his form was
                    changed by the linking and it was a great sacrifice even for one as great as him. A vast amount
                    of generations passed, we would obviously have many of unkindled and, of course, many amount of
                    tombs in the Cemetery of Ash. We also fight against a manifestation of all Undead who linked the
                    fire, that is, the Soul of Cinder, who seems to be good at all fighting styles.
                    <br>
                    Another hint supporting that Lords of Cinder did not burn completely and stayed alive after
                    linking the fire is the fact that all unkindled resurrect with their human forms. All Lords of
                    Cinder wake up with their charred corpses, like Ludleth, and they all seem to have gained
                    certain amount of fire power, juding by their boss fights. Aldrich did not die either, he had a
                    vision of an upcoming Age of the Deep Sea, so he started devouring Gods.
                    <br>
                    The last detail relating the Unkindled to all of the previous Undead who sacrified themselves
                    for the Flame is found in a song. The name of this song is mentioned in the intro of DSIII. when
                    you beat DSI you see your character burning in the kiln and then The Nameless Song starts to
                    play. This sad tone is played at the end of your quest and it is what defines your character.
                    Our characters did everything and died a thousand of times just to be a sacrifice to extend the
                    age of the gods. It happened many times, and they are nameless, no one is going to remember
                    their names or write poems about them.
                    <br>
                    Whatever unkindled are, their task is clear. They have to seek out the Lords Of Cinder in order
                    to reenact relinking the First Flame and preserve the age of fire. They are also undead who are
                    not fully bound by the hollowing process we saw in past games, needing to acquire Dark Sigils in
                    order to go Hollow.
                    <br>
                    The Lords of Cinder
                    "If the lords will not return to their thrones themselves, let them return as cinders."
                    <br>
                    One becomes a Lord of Cinder by relinking the First Flame in the Kiln and Surviving. There are
                    currently 5 Lords of Cinder, all 5 of their ashes are needed to reenact the Linking of the First
                    Flame. The 5 Lords are Aldrich Saint of the Deep, Ludleth the Exiled, Yhorm the Giant, Farron's
                    Undead Legion, and Lothric, the last hope of his line.
                    <br>
                    Ludleth the Exiled linked the First Flame long ago by willing himself to. Aldrich was once a
                    cleric that devoured men. He became so powerful that he was used to relink the Flame. Upon
                    ascension to a Lord of Cinder, Aldrich sought to devour gods and even gained a cult around him
                    that formed the Sable Church of the Deep.
                    <br>
                    Farron's Undead Legion of Abyss Watchers partook of the blood of an ancient wolf, the Wolf's
                    blood linked the Abyss watchers to their master, the legendary Artorias of the Abyss. Emulating
                    Artorias, the Abyss Wachers guard against creatures from the Abyss. The Abyss Watchers swore on
                    their share Wolf's Blood to relink the Flame.
                    <br>
                    Yhorm the Giant sought to end the Profaned flame by relinking the First Flame. Instead of
                    Eliminating the Profaned Flame, the capital burned killing all except Yhorm. Pontif Sulyvahn
                    travelled to the Profaned Capital and saw the Profaned Flame. This hints that Yhorm linked the
                    Flame before Aldrich.
                    <br>
                    Lothric refused to relink the Flame, choosing instead to allow the Flame to fade as he watched
                    it from a distance with his brother.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Deep
                    "The deep was originally a peaceful and sacred place, but became the final rest for many
                    abhorrent things. This tale of the Deep offers protection for those who worship amidst those
                    horrors."
                    <br>
                    "These insects which lurk in the Deep have tiny jaws lined with fangs to tear open the skin and
                    burrow into the flesh in the blink of an eye, causing intense bleeding."
                    <br>
                    "Souls which swell from the deep pursue their target, drawn towards life."
                    <br>
                    "A gem of infused titanite. Found in the dregs of the Cathedral of the deep. Used in infusion to
                    create deep weapons. Deep weapons inflict dark damage, but lose scaling effects. There is a
                    darkness that lies beyond human ken."
                    <br>
                    As stated in the Dark Souls summary, the Abyss was not created until the events that took place
                    in Oolacile, and it was born after Manus humanity went wild due to torture. Humanity is
                    described as something warm but at the same time dangerous, so when disturbed it created the
                    Abyss. Artorias traveled here in order to stop it and it is stated, in his ring, that he made a
                    pact with the creatures of the abyss not to be corrupted and killed. This part is key because we
                    are told that humanity is born from the dark soul, which implies darkness. But this darkness is
                    not inneherntly evil, until it got disturbed, and created the Abyss. The Abyss corrupts
                    everything and kills everyone but it seems that some creatures inhabit this peculiar place.
                    <br>
                    From the descriptions above we can see that the Deep was initially calm but it became a place
                    for abhorrent creatures. There are insects in the Deep that basically kill all life. The Deep is
                    Dark, but a Dark that lies beyond humanity, which is also dark. The Deep could be the Abyss.
                    When Lord Souls are disrupted you create monstruosities. The Witch of Izalith tried to create a
                    First Flame with her own Lord Soul and she just created Chaos. Oolacile people disrupted a
                    fragment of the Dark Soul ( Manus) and they created the Abyss.
                    <br>
                    A last hint about the nature of the Deep is given by the Farron's Undead Legion boss soul
                    weapons, the Wolf Knight's Greatsword and the Farron Greatsword, since both swords deal a bonus
                    damage against Aldrich and the Deacons of the Deep. These weapons are designed to fight against
                    the abyss, and deal more damage to abyssal foes, hence Aldrich and the Deacons are related to
                    the Abyss.
                    <br>
                    Aldrich, Saint of the Deep
                    Aldrich is another Lord of Cinder that neglected his duties, having his own ambitions after the
                    linking of the fire. He was a cleric in the past but at some point he started eating human
                    flesh, and he sure enjoyed it, as can be seen from Aldrich Ruby or Saphire:
                    <br>
                    "Infamous for his appetite for flesh apparently had the desire to share with others his joy of
                    imbibing the final shudders of life while luxuriating in his victim's screams"
                    <br>
                    He is probably the founder of the Cathedral of the Deep, where he got some followers for his
                    cult, maybe due to fear. His victims were transported from the Undead Settlement to the
                    Cathedral through the Road of Sacrifices. This is inferred from the Evangelist Set:
                    <br>
                    "These teachers, all women, came to enlighten inhabitants of the Undead Settlement and sent
                    carriers on the path of sacrifice."
                    <br>
                    It is also stated that Horace did evade being devoured alive and survived, along with other
                    children, hinted to be Anri. This hint comes mainly from the fixation of Anri to kill Aldrich
                    ever since our first encounter, being even a summon. Horace Exceutioner's Armor also tells us
                    something:
                    <br>
                    "Steel armor of Horace the Hushed, who took a liking to its cold, bulky insides. The original
                    owner was said to be a corrupt executioner, who was killed and stripped of his armor. Horace is
                    one of only two children to escape Aldrich's clutches."
                    <br>
                    At some point the flame started to fade and the Undead curse arose again, so he probably ate
                    undead humans too. What points this out is the high amount of weak undead bodies outside the
                    cathedral, bodies that Aldrich did not finish, as the grave warden set seems to suggest:
                    <br>
                    "Rotting, tattered skirt, robe, hood and wrap. Attire of grave wardens at the Cathedral of the
                    Deep. Grave wardens were tasked with disposing of the ever rising corpses that plagued the
                    cathedral. Their clothes are utterly putrid, drenched in the blood and mucilage of their
                    undertaking."
                    <br>
                    We said before that Aldrich started being a cleric, but then he got corrupted. It is unknown
                    wether the corruption took place before eating so many humans but he grew (pun intended) fond of
                    The Abyss. It could be that, after killing so many humans and enjoying the suffering from his
                    victims while they were being eaten alive, he disrupted a significant amount of the dark soul,
                    turning himself into an abyss like creature.
                    <br>
                    After some time, whoever ruled the kingdom made him link the flame, not for saint but for might,
                    as Hawkwood tells us. He then had visions of the upcoming age of the Deep Sea so he started
                    devouring Gods instead. This might have two possible explanations. The age of fire means the age
                    of Gods, so he would try to get rid of all the gods for one day ruling in an age of dark.
                    Second, he would need to become something more powerful to survive if The Abyss spreads. Cinders
                    of a Lord and Soul of Aldrich respectively read:
                    <br>
                    " Aldrich became a lord by devouring men, but was disillusioned with his throne, and so took to
                    devouring gods instead."
                    <br>
                    "When Aldrich ruminated on the fading of the fire, it inspired visions of a coming age of the
                    deep sea. He knew the path would be arduous, but he had no fear. He would devour the gods
                    himself."
                    <br>
                    In any case, he devoured some Gods and linked the fire, then his body of cinder was took to the
                    tomb. When he awakened he marched from the Cathedral to Anor Londo to have a gift from Sulyvahn,
                    Gwyndolin. It is possible that when we fight him he is still devouring the god of the darkmoon,
                    since we still see part of him. If this is right then it means that Priscilla is alive, since he
                    had a dream about her while devouring Gwyndolin. Darkmoon Longbow and Lifehunt Scythe:
                    <br>
                    "Longbow of Darkmoon Gwyndolin, who was gradually devoured by Aldrich.This golden bow is imbued
                    with powerful magic and is most impressive with Moonlight Arrows."
                    <br>
                    "Aldrich dreamt as he slowly devoured the God of the Darkmoon. In this dream, he perceived the
                    form of a young, pale girl in hiding."
                    <br>
                    The Profaned Flame
                    Profaned Flame wielded by the Irithyllian witches. Lonely Yhorm became a Lord of Cinder to put
                    the Profaned Flame to rest, knowing full well that those who spoke of him as lord were quite
                    insincere. The Profaned Capital was consumed by fire after Yhorm the Giant became a Lord of
                    Cinder. The fire, born of the sky, is said to have incinerated naught but human flesh. The
                    Profaned Flame was triggered by the curse of these women, relatives of a certain oracle, but
                    despite their culpability, they went on living, without any cares.

                    The Darksign and the Eclipse
                    The Darksign is a symbol of the undead. Those cursed with it are reborn after death and
                    eventually lose their minds and turn hollow. This is a reason why undead are driven from their
                    homes as they eventually go mad. Horace is a sample of this, originally being a member of the
                    Blue Sentinals covenant and stated friend of Anri, but later being found attacking anyone he
                    meets.
                    <br>
                    The eclipse appears in Lothric Castle, and several other areas, after Lothric Castle is
                    unlocked. It may be a sign called by the fading flame, and looks a bit like a Darksign.
                    *Speculation* Maybe it's calling Undead to link it and prolong its life. Maybe its symbolizing
                    that the Fire is fading and the Age of Fire is ending.

                    <br>
                    Multiple Firelink Shrines
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Sword missing from the shrine bonfire. Thrust into the shrine bonfire to restore its power and
                    enable travel between bonfires. This sword is only bequeathed to chosen ash, as judged by the
                    Iudex, who awaits the arrival of ash as a scabbard"
                    <br>
                    When you start the game you find yourself in the Cemetery of Ash and venture to Firelink Shrine.
                    In this Firelink Shrine you must insert the Coiled Sword into the bone and ash pile of the
                    bonfire to be able to use it. When you use the Firelink bonfire to warp to Lothric for the first
                    time you are warped to an altar with a basin and a broken coiled sword.
                    <br>
                    Fragment of the coiled sword of a bonfire which served its purpose long ago. Returns caster to
                    last bonfire used for resting, or to the bonfire in Firelink Shrine. Can be used repeatedly.
                    Bonfires are linked to one another irreversibly, retaining their affinity long after their
                    purpose is exhausted
                    <br>
                    Later on in the game you come across an area identical to Firelink called Untended Graves. Here
                    you find a dark shrine with a Fragment of the Coiled Sword in it.
                    <br>
                    Towards the end of the game on your journey to the Kiln, you are warped to one more copy of
                    Firelink called the Flameless Shrine. The Flameless Shrine is in even worse condition than
                    Untended Graves and it is here you find a bonfire that warps you to the Kiln.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    THEORY 1
                    <br>
                    There are three versions of firelink shrine. The first is where we appear, good old fire link,
                    its filled with friendly npcs, Andre, handmaid, firekeeper...the rest of those lovable guys.
                    Once the consumed king is defeated, we are given access to an illusory wall that leads us to
                    untended graves. Suprisingly, this area is a mimic of firelink. Except its consumed by the
                    abyss, no sky, all blackness. Is this a similar building? No its not. Messages you leave in
                    firelink will match messages found in the "dark" firelink accessed through untended graves. As
                    well as items brought over by npcs, like the scrolls of Orbeck, or the pots and goods of
                    Greirat. It is the same building. But how? Speculation time!
                    <br>
                    Time travel. This may sound odd, but forces in souls game have enabled time travel, like the
                    memory areas in dark souls 2. This dark version is firelink of the present. This is also why you
                    have to warp to Lothric, or time travel to Lothric by the bonfire as the actually current state
                    of the bonfire is well, its dead, consumed by the abyss. Im going to speculate harder by
                    suggesting that time power is how the bonfire heals and why armor is "repaired" when you rest as
                    well as enemies being resetted. It can reset certain aspects of the world. But its not exactly
                    reversing everything, as certain things remain changed. This theory has holes as well, activated
                    levers stay activated, and certain enemies stay killed if killed...etc.
                    <br>
                    Anyway, back on topic, still with time travel. So the dark shrine may be our shrine, but in the
                    future. Ive tried skipping Orbeck and Greirat, just murdering Emma and getting there, and the
                    scrolls and pots in my previous play through were not there. When I found them, the items they
                    left stayed there. We even have a corpse of a fire keeper that drops the eyes of a fire keeper,
                    which is hidden in an illusory wall where the nun would stay. So basically the firelink from the
                    past is trying to save itself and prevent its current, dark shrine state. As to why the handmaid
                    is still alive, I have no idea. Maybe she hid with an item, maybe she killed them all. Maybe she
                    was spared as she is just an old lady.
                    <br>
                    Then we have the next flame. The one that takes us to the final boss. Its a ruined version of
                    firelink, this one is damaged with up with many collapsed pathways. Upon exiting it we find
                    lothric and a strange dark, sort of night atmosphere. We seem to have a crazy eclipse going on,
                    and it looks like part of the earth was torn off or ripped out and sent somewhere else. The
                    Lothric castle has parts of it collapsed and sloped, like some crazy earthquake or event
                    occured. This could be firelink of the future. Please note that while the dark firelink shrine
                    is covered in an abyss, the rest of Lothric is fine. This is because the firelink shrine,
                    birthplace of the powerful fire, is a special ground. Its paranormal. As the fire weakens and
                    dies, its surrounding area goes to hell. It is swallowed in an abyss and seems to be separated
                    from the world(dark shrine). This gets worse in the future as now the firelink and its
                    surrounding area seems to be caught in a crazy cataclysm(final area). Its become some vortex
                    that sucks its surroundings to where ever it came from, though very slowly. More speculation!
                    this vortex converges the surrounding lands into the source of the flame. The thing we actually
                    link. Think of it like this, the fire is hurting and its trying to pull back to safety because
                    of the pain. as everything converges, the source is revealed, and the champion of ash may
                    fullfill his duty, link it, prolong its life in our world of plane, and change the future,
                    extending the age of fire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    THEORY2
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That was wild and filled with speculation, sorry bout that, here is a shorter theory! Another
                    possibility, is a parallel world, an alternate universe of sorts. We know that undead keep
                    reviving. Hawkwood says it himself that they " cant die properly". But why does Hawkwood die
                    properly when we kill him? Why does killing Aldrich with Anri, have no influence on the Aldrich
                    of our world. ( Killing him w Anri will not mean that the one we have to face will be dead, you
                    have to kill the one in your world, regardless if you helped Anri slay him ). I think to each
                    undead, the fire presents a "parallel world". Killing an npc will revive them in their world,
                    but in our world, they will have lost "connection" and appear "dead". Npcs very connected to our
                    world, like the firekeeper, will revive just like monsters, if killed. All the others are like
                    other players, with a weaker, sort of temporary connection.
                    <br>
                    Anyway, theory two is that the first flame is fading, so fire from other "worlds" all connected
                    to it, help it out. The first one is the fire that called our particular character from the
                    cemetary. Hawkwood and Anri were possibly called by different flames from different parallel
                    worlds. This first flame needs attention as its like the heart of all the other flames, they
                    need it and stuff. The dark version of firelink shrine is a fire that faded, a possible fate
                    awaiting the fires of other worlds if the main one isnt fixed. The third one, the "kiln of the
                    first flame". Is a parallel world that serves as a "doorway" or entrance to the main flame. Its
                    the world where the power of fire is strongest, and whe whole place is falling apart as the main
                    one is weakening. We travel there to fix the thing.

                    <br>
                    When the Flame is about to burn out a bell is wrung awakening the Lords of Cinder and the
                    Unkindled.

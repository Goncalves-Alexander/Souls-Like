                <h4>Dark Souls boss</h4>
                <span>Ornstein was one of Lord Gwyn's most trusted knights, who was also loyal to Lord Gwyn's Firstborn.
                    Believed to be the captain of the Four Knights of Gwyn, he was granted a special soul and ring by
                    the Lord of Sunlight.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    His golden armor was made to resemble a lion and was imbued with the power of lightning. It is said
                    that his lugged spear could slice a boulder in two. After the gods fled Anor Londo, Ornstein and
                    Executioner Smough were stationed to guard its cathedral, and the princess of sunlight within it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At some point, Ornstein left the cathedral in search of the Nameless King. It is unclear how
                    Ornstein survived the battle against the Chosen Undead, but it appears he eventually found his way
                    to Archdragon Peak. However, the results of his search, as well as Ornstein's own fate, remains
                    unknown.</span>

                    boss is known as the 'False King' because it is not the REAL Allant. After Allant allied with the
                    Old One, he was given immense power. Using this power, he fashioned a demon made in his own image,
                    made to look like his old self at the height of his power. This demon would lead the demon armies
                    against Boletaria.</span>

                    <h1>Demon's Souls</h1>
                    <span>The world was once victim to a previous scourge of Demons in an ancient past before King
                        Allant
                        came to the throne. The Old One, an entity of unfathomable power, had awakened the bane of
                        existence
                        into the world, unleashing terrible Demons that ripped the land asunder, consequently
                        exterminating
                        half of humankind. Those that would become the Monumentals sought to spare the land from further
                        harm, and combined with their knowledge of Soul Arts, returned the Old One back to its slumber.
                        To
                        divide the lands amidst different regions and to return life to where there was none, they
                        ordered
                        Archstones be constructed and placed throughout the world, all of which were connected to a
                        central
                        Archstone used for inter-regional travel.</span>

                        The world of Dark Souls is a world of cycles. Kingdoms rise and fall,
                        ages come and go, and
                        even
                        time can end and restart as the flame fades and is renewed. These cycles are linked to the
                        First
                        Flame, a mysterious manifestation of life that divides and defines separate states such as
                        heat
                        and
                        cold, or life and death. As the First Flame fades, these differences also begin to fade,
                        such as
                        life and death having little distinction, and humans becoming Undead.

                        The hunters are a group of warriors who are dedicated to keeping their regions safe by hunting
                        down beasts - or anything other than beasts if need be - that pose a threat. Hunters are agile
                        fighters armed with a trick weapon, a transforming melee weapon in the right hand, and a firearm
                        in the left. They do not employ shields, but rather take advantage of their mobility in order to
                        avoid attacks. Hunters exist throughout the world and are not exclusive to Yharnam, since a
                        number of characters such as the protagonist and Eileen come from the outside world and are yet
                        still recognized as hunters. However, it is believed that the Hunters started out as a branch of
                        the Healing Church very much like The Choir. This would mean that, at least in Yharnam, Hunters
                        were recruited by either Gehrman or the Church itself.
